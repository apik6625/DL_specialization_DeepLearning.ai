    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first assignment of Week 2, Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization! \n",
    "\n",
    "Because word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train, most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings. In this notebook you'll try your hand at loading, measuring similarity between, and modifying pre-trained embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "**After this assignment you'll be able to**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain how word embeddings capture relationships between words\n",
    "* Load pre-trained word vectors\n",
    "* Measure similarity between word vectors using cosine similarity\n",
    "* Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to ______.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you'll have a chance to try an optional exercise, where you'll modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias. Reducing bias is an important consideration in ML, so you're encouraged to take this challenge!  \n",

    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/supplement/qHIve/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

If you're using a 50-dimensional word embedding, the 50 dimensional space can be split into two parts: The bias-direction $g$, and the remaining 49 dimensions, which is called $g_{\\perp}$ here. In linear algebra, we say that the 49-dimensional $g_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular (or \"orthogonal\") to $g$, meaning it is at 90 degrees to $g$. The neutralization step takes a vector such as $e_{receptionist}$ and zeros out the component in the direction of $g$, giving us $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$. \n",

As a concrete example, suppose that \"actress\" is closer to \"babysit\" than \"actor.\" By applying neutralization to \"babysit,\" you can reduce the gender stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that \"actor\" and \"actress\" are equidistant from \"babysit.\" The equalization algorithm takes care of this. \n",

    "These debiasing algorithms are very helpful for reducing bias, but aren't perfect and don't eliminate all traces of bias. For example, one weakness of this implementation was that the bias direction $g$ was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and _man_. As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, you would obtain a better estimate of the \"gender\" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space. Feel free to play with these types of variants as well! "
